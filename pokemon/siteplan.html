        Who is Pokappraiser for? Pokappraiser is meant for the PokemonGo players who are searching for those perfect stat pokemon. If you have played PokemonGo for any stretch of time, you will know that there are several of each pokemon that you can find out in the wild, and each of those pokemon has hidden stats. Those stats are attack, defense, and stamina. They are also fixed, which means that once you catch a pokemon, if it has poor defense, it will always have poor defense.
This means that if a player finds a pokemon with perfect 15’s in those hidden stats, they had better catch it, or they would be passing up a rare opportunity. The flip side of that is true as well, if a pokemon has poor stats, catching it would be a waste for those casual players, who don’t have as many pokeballs as the pros do, to catch it because the pokeball is more important because it could have caught a better pokemon.
How does Pokappraiser fix that problem? Well when you go to catch a pokemon, you will see the name, and then you will see a number next to its name. That number is its combat power, or CP value. The number is different based on the pokemon itself and the level of the pokemon as well. There are tens of thousands of different combinations of CP values and pokemon names, but there aren’t an infinite amount. That means that if you know every possible combination of pokemon name and CP value, you could know from the second you see the pokemon, before ever throwing a ball, whether or not that pokemon has perfect hidden stats. 
Thats where we come in. We have access to that archive of entries of pokemon names, possible statistics, CP values, levels, and more. That means that all you need to do when you come across a pokemon is search its name and CP value in the search bar above, and we will tell you every last detail that we have about that pokemon, as well has whether or not it has those perfect stats, and as a result, whether or not you should spend a pokeball on it.
Now, that is the main reason you ought to visit our site rather than some other CP calculator out there, because we are transparent. While another CP calculator may just give you future CP values of a pokemon once it evolves, we will give you information on every hidden stat, every health point, every level, and every detail that we know about your pokemon, and we can do it before you even know that yourself! All you need to do is plug in two things and you will get every piece of information that you could look for.
In fact, you don’t even need to search it through the search bar. If you tab over to the ‘table’ tab, you will see our entire archive of every pokemon entry that we have. We know that transparency is important, and that information is powerful, which is why we give you both.
Now we know that PokemonGo is an ever changing game with lots of updates and tweaks, and nobody can help us more than you, which is why we take your input as well. If you have a pokemon that doesn’t appear in our records of possible pokemon, you can submit an entry request containing everything you know about your pokemon, and we will add it to our records so that other players can also keep an eye out for it! That way you can help your fellow players find those perfect stat pokemon!

      <h3>Archive</h3>
      <p>
        After consulting ChatGPT, I don't know whether I will have the entire database printed on a single page of this website because it would have about 30,000 rows and about 20 columns per row, which might slow down the load times of the website, and frankly nobody probably wants to read that anyway.
